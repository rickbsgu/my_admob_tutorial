# my_admob_tutorial

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

> NOTE: Project is modified version of the [admob_ads_in_flutter](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/admob-ads-in-flutter) repo, with the codelabs tutorial here: [Adding Admob Ads to a Flutter App](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/admob-ads-in-flutter/#3).
>
> The project would not build as of this writing, nor did it implement _appAd_.  This project builds as of 08-May-22, and I've added an _appAd_.  See tags list.

Tags:
 - starter: the start point if you want to follow along the tutorial
 - completed: the end point of the tutorial
 - bonus_AppAd_with_numruns_filter: a bonus level, the original didn't have an appAd, which I've added plus other changes. See the note in lib/home_route.dart.
